# normal-tanks - Java-Based 2D Tank Battle Game

normal-tanks is a 2D tank battle game developed in Java, designed to showcase proficiency in game development, network programming, and object-oriented principles. This project implements both single-player and two-player cooperative modes.

## Key Technical Features

* **Core Language:** Java
* **Network Communication:** Socket programming for real-time, two-player gameplay. Client-server architecture.
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Modular and extensible codebase utilizing OOP principles.
* **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Implementation of relevant data structures and algorithms for game logic, collision detection, etc.
* **Game Logic:** Implementation of game mechanics, AI, physics (if any), and user input handling.

## Game Features

* Two-player cooperative mode over a network.
* Single-player mode against AI opponents.
* Tank control with mouse aiming and keyboard movement.
* Two weapon types: cannon and machine gun.
* Destructible environments and interactive elements.
* Various enemy types with different behaviors.
* Power-up system (ammo, health, weapon upgrades).
* Multiple difficulty levels.

## Technical Details

The project demonstrates the following programming skills:

* **Network Programming:** Socket-based communication, client-server architecture, data serialization.
